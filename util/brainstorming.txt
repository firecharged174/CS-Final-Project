What do we want to have for the player? 
    - Money amount: 
        -random per each player
            -$10 to $100 
        -Change after purchase
        -Decimal values?
        -Do we assign a set amount of bills?
    - What they bought - inventory
    - Their name 

How many rows and columns of stuff?
    -4x4 or something like that, smaller, or we could go bigger
    -4x4 means 16 items min in the list so maybe 3x4 for 12 min items

Names of rows and colums?
    -A1, A2, A3
    -B1, B2, B3
    -C1, C2. C3
    -D1, D2, D3

Whats in the vending machine?  
    -items.json 
    -another data structure?

What data struc. we gonna use?
    -Queue
         -Each slot will have random item behind it (i.e A1 - Cheetos, then MM, then Snickers) 
         and not just a queue of cheetos
    -ArrayList 
        -of player inventory


do we want multiple players to be able to give eachother money or is that unnecessary?

Should there be a way to make new money or 'refresh' the vending machine?


Hows it gonna work?
-------------------
Each button will be its own Queue of random items. Each queue will be of random length.
Each player will have a unique player object. All player objects will be saved to player.dat 


//I think we need to make objects for all the items in the game. Each would include say its name, imageicon and price,
    //cuz i actually dont know how else we can save all the information for each. Then that begs the question, how do we do that?

    //Ok a thought just occurred to me, why dont we create a temporary file that can write all the item objects to an items.bin,
    //and we can read from that, just like the player objects
